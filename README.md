# Ikari

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE.txt)

Ikari is a game engine project written in pure rust for learning about rust and game tech. It is developed to have decent visuals and good performance, ideally supporting frame rates of 144 or higher.

Most of the rendering features were implemented by following the awesome tutorials on [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/) and [learnwgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/).

Hopefully one day it will be used in a real game ðŸ˜ƒ

## Features:

- Physically-Based Rendering materials (PBR)
- Image-Based Lighting
- Point and directional lights
- Soft shadow edges with randomized Percentage Closer Filtering
- Adjustable Bloom
- Adjustable camera exposure
- Skeletal animations
- Auto-generated box collision meshes, including support for skinned characters
- [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/) integration for physics
- [Oddio](https://github.com/Ralith/oddio) integration for audio
- [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) integration for UI
- [wgpu-profiler](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler)
- Dynamic render scale
  - Can be used to do supersampling anti-aliasing
- glTF asset import
  - Supports scene graph, meshes, materials, animations, and skinning
- Linux, Windows & MacOS support
- Wireframe mode
- Unlit materials
- Equirectangular and cubemap skybox support
- Scene graph
- CPU-side frustum culling
- Mipmapping
- Reverse-Z for better depth accuracy / less z-fighting

## TODO

- add a start button to the web build for audio purpose
- fix scroll wheel on web

## Try it out

```sh
# native
RUST_LOG=ikari=debug,wgpu=warn RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run --release --features="tracy" --bin example_game
# web
cargo build-web --release --bin example_game
```

See console logs for list of available controls

## Profiling
You can profile ikari with [tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) via [profiling](https://github.com/aclysma/profiling) crate.
To do that you have to:
- Download [tracy 0.9](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/tag/v0.9)
- Build ikari by adding --features="tracy" to the cargo command
- Run ikari and tracy (in any order), when the game is loading tracy will start profiling

If something does not work it is possible that the crate profiling has been updated and is no longer aligned with the tracy version and a more recent one must be used.

### Tracy linux install:

Based on instructions from here: https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/issues/484

- Install glfw, freetype2
  - (e.g. aur packages `glfw-x11`, `freetype2`). maybe different on Ubuntu
- Install libcapstone
  - Clone https://github.com/libcapstone/libcapstone
  - cd libcapstone
  - PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin CC=clang CXX=clang++ make -j12
  - sudo make install
- Install tracy 0.9
  - Clone https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy
  - cd tracy/profiler/build/unix
  - git checkout v0.9
  - PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin CC=clang CXX=clang++ make -j12
- Run tracy
  - ./Tracy_release
- I made a desktop entry to make it easier to start from the system menus:
  - Not sure if it works in other distros, tested on Arch/KDE
  - Create file ~/.local/share/applications/tracy.desktop with contents:
    ```
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Tracy
    Exec=/home/david/Programming/tracy/profiler/build/unix/Tracy-release
    Type=Application
    ```
